**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** December 2024

## Introduction

This document outlines the modular workstreams and detailed execution prompts for implementing the digiMe agentic system. It builds upon the `digiMe Agentic Architecture Design` and the `digiMe Functional Requirements Document (FRD) v1.0`. The workstreams are designed for efficient execution by an AI co-pilot, breaking down the complex implementation into manageable phases with clear objectives, deliverables, and handover summaries to ensure seamless integration and high-quality output.

Each workstream represents a major functional area of the digiMe system. Within each workstream, phases define specific development sprints. Each phase includes a detailed execution prompt that guides the AI co-pilot through the implementation steps, including code generation, testing, and documentation.

### Phase 1.1: Agent Orchestration Framework Setup

**Objective:** Implement the central agent orchestration framework responsible for managing agent interactions, routing requests, and maintaining shared context.

**Execution Prompt:**

```markdown
**Phase 1.1: Agent Orchestration Framework Setup - Execution Prompt**

**Objective:** Implement the core Agent Orchestration Framework for digiMe.

**Based on:** `digiMe Agentic Architecture Design` (Section 2.1) and FRD (FR-DM-SYS-001, FR-DM-SYS-002).

**Key Tasks:**

1.  **Design and Implement the Orchestration Layer:**
    *   Define data structures for managing registered agents, their capabilities, and current status.
    *   Implement a request routing mechanism that directs incoming user requests or system events to the appropriate specialized agent or group of agents.
    *   Develop a shared context module that agents can securely access and update. This context should include user preferences, current activity, and relevant environmental data.

2.  **Implement Agent Registration and Discovery:**
    *   Develop a mechanism for specialized agents to register themselves with the orchestrator, declaring their capabilities and communication endpoints.
    *   Implement a discovery service that allows the orchestrator to find and communicate with active agents.

3.  **Develop Basic Inter-Agent Communication Protocol:**
    *   Define a secure and efficient communication protocol (e.g., using gRPC or a message queue like RabbitMQ/Kafka, ensuring encryption in transit) for messages between the orchestrator and specialized agents.
    *   Implement basic message types for requests, responses, and status updates.

4.  **Initial Privacy Agent Stub and Zero-Knowledge Foundation:**
    *   Create a stub for the Privacy Agent that will later manage encryption and privacy-preserving computations.
    *   Implement foundational cryptographic libraries and secure key generation/storage placeholders that the Privacy Agent will manage. Ensure these are designed for client-side operations where applicable.
    *   Define initial data handling policies that enforce zero-knowledge principles from the outset (e.g., no unencrypted sensitive data logging by the orchestrator).

5.  **Logging and Monitoring:**
    *   Implement a secure logging mechanism for the orchestration framework that records operational events without logging sensitive user data, adhering to FR-DM-SYS-005.
    *   Set up basic monitoring for the orchestrator's health and performance.

6.  **Unit Tests:**

**Handover Summary (for Phase 1.2):**

The core Agent Orchestration Framework is now established. It can register agents, route basic requests, and manage a shared context. The foundational elements for the Privacy Agent and zero-knowledge architecture are in place, including cryptographic library integration and secure logging. The next phase will focus on implementing the core functionalities of the Privacy Agent, particularly client-side encryption and key management.
```

### Phase 1.2: Privacy Agent - Core Encryption and Key Management

**Objective:** Implement the core functionalities of the Privacy Agent, focusing on client-side encryption, secure key management, and ensuring all data handling adheres to zero-knowledge principles.

**Execution Prompt:**

```markdown
**Phase 1.2: Privacy Agent - Core Encryption and Key Management - Execution Prompt**

**Objective:** Implement core Privacy Agent functionalities: client-side encryption, secure key management, and enforcement of zero-knowledge principles.

**Based on:** `digiMe Agentic Architecture Design` (Sections 2.2 - Privacy Agent, 5.1, 5.3) and FRD (FR-DM-SYS-001, FR-DM-SYS-002, FR-DM-SYS-004, FR-DM-SEC-002, FR-DM-SEC-003).

**Key Tasks:**

1.  **Implement Client-Side Encryption/Decryption Module:**
    *   Develop robust client-side JavaScript (or equivalent for the target client platform) modules for encrypting document content and sensitive metadata *before* it is sent to any backend service.
    *   Use strong, industry-standard symmetric encryption algorithms (e.g., AES-256 GCM).
    *   Implement secure decryption modules for use on the client-side when viewing documents.

2.  **Develop Secure Key Management System:**
    *   Design and implement a system for generating, storing, and managing user-specific encryption keys. Keys must be derived from user credentials (e.g., password, using PBKDF2 or Argon2) and never stored unencrypted by the system.
    *   Implement mechanisms for secure key recovery (e.g., using recovery phrases or trusted device methods), ensuring the recovery process itself does not compromise key security or zero-knowledge principles.
    *   Address key rotation strategies if applicable, ensuring data can be re-encrypted with new keys without data loss.

3.  **Integrate Privacy Agent with Orchestrator:**
    *   Flesh out the Privacy Agent stub created in Phase 1.1.
    *   The Privacy Agent should expose services to other agents (via the orchestrator) for requesting encryption/decryption operations *only if absolutely necessary and designed such that the Privacy Agent itself doesn't see unencrypted data* (e.g., by operating on data streams or providing transformation functions).
    *   Primarily, the Privacy Agent should provide guidance and enforce policies for other agents regarding data handling, rather than directly handling unencrypted data.

4.  **Enforce Zero-Knowledge Policies:**
    *   Implement checks and balances within the Privacy Agent and orchestrator to ensure that no unencrypted sensitive user data is logged, transmitted to unsecure endpoints, or stored server-side.
    *   Develop mechanisms for data sanitization or anonymization if any aggregate analytics are planned (though this should be strictly limited and transparent).

5.  **Secure Communication Channels:**
    *   Ensure all communication between client, agents, and backend services uses TLS/SSL by default.
    *   The Privacy Agent should be able to audit or verify the security of these channels.

6.  **Unit and Integration Tests:**
    *   Write unit tests for encryption/decryption modules, key generation, and key derivation functions.
    *   Write integration tests to verify that data remains encrypted throughout its lifecycle and that the Privacy Agent correctly enforces policies.

**Deliverables:**

*   Source code for the enhanced Privacy Agent.
*   Client-side encryption/decryption libraries/modules.
*   Secure key management system components.
*   Updated API documentation for the Privacy Agent (internal).
*   Comprehensive unit and integration test suite.
*   Documentation on the key management and recovery process.

**Handover Summary (for Phase 2.1):**

The Privacy Agent now provides core client-side encryption and secure key management. Zero-knowledge principles are actively enforced. The system foundation is secure for handling sensitive user documents. The next phase will begin implementing the Document Intelligence Agent, starting with document ingestion and initial processing, leveraging the established privacy framework.
```

This workstream focuses on building the agent responsible for understanding, analyzing, and processing documents.

### Phase 2.1: Document Ingestion and Initial Processing

**Objective:** Implement the initial capabilities of the Document Intelligence Agent for ingesting documents from various sources and performing basic processing (e.g., type identification, metadata extraction) while adhering to privacy protocols.

**Execution Prompt:**

```markdown
**Phase 2.1: Document Ingestion and Initial Processing - Execution Prompt**

**Objective:** Implement Document Intelligence Agent's capabilities for multi-source document ingestion and initial, privacy-preserving processing.

**Based on:** `digiMe Agentic Architecture Design` (Sections 2.2 - Document Intelligence Agent, 3.1) and FRD (FR-DM-DP-001, FR-DM-SYS-001, FR-DM-SYS-004).

**Key Tasks:**

1.  **Develop Document Ingestion Modules:**
    *   Implement modules for ingesting documents from:
        *   Direct file uploads (web/mobile client).
        *   Camera capture (interfacing with frontend camera module - stub out if not yet available, focus on backend handling).
        *   Email-to-Vault (requires setting up an email listener/processor - see FR-DM-BE-004).
        *   Share extensions (OS-level integration - define API for client to call).
    *   Handle various common document types (PDF, DOCX, TXT, JPG, PNG). Implement initial type identification based on MIME types and file extensions.

2.  **Implement Initial Processing Pipeline:**
    *   Once a document is received (client-side, before encryption for initial analysis if possible, or server-side on encrypted data if necessary), extract basic metadata (filename, size, creation/modification dates from file system).
    *   If client-side processing is feasible for pre-encryption analysis (e.g., basic text extraction from TXT, or image dimensions), implement this. Otherwise, design for server-side processing of encrypted data where only encrypted blobs are stored.
    *   The Document Intelligence Agent should coordinate with the Privacy Agent to ensure documents are encrypted *before* persistent storage or transmission beyond the initial client-side processing boundary.

3.  **Define Document Representation:**
    *   Define a standardized internal representation for documents, including their encrypted content, metadata (some of which might also need encryption), source, and processing status.

4.  **Integration with Orchestrator and Privacy Agent:**
    *   Register the Document Intelligence Agent with the Orchestrator.
    *   Implement communication flows where the Document Intelligence Agent receives ingestion requests/notifications from the Orchestrator.
    *   Ensure all document handling strictly follows policies enforced by the Privacy Agent (e.g., all documents are passed to the client-side encryption module provided by the Privacy Agent before being marked for storage).

5.  **Error Handling and Logging:**
    *   Implement robust error handling for ingestion failures (e.g., unsupported file types, network issues).
    *   Log operational details securely, without exposing sensitive content, as per Privacy Agent guidelines.

    *   Write unit tests for each ingestion module, metadata extraction, and interaction with the Privacy Agent for encryption.

**Deliverables:**

*   Source code for the Document Intelligence Agent's ingestion modules.
*   Initial document processing pipeline components.
*   Standardized document representation model.
*   Unit tests for all new functionalities.
*   Documentation on the ingestion process and supported formats.

**Handover Summary (for Phase 2.2):**

The Document Intelligence Agent can now ingest documents from multiple sources and perform initial processing and metadata extraction. All ingested documents are handled in coordination with the Privacy Agent to ensure client-side encryption before storage. The next phase will focus on implementing OCR capabilities to extract text from image-based documents and PDFs, making their content searchable (in an encrypted manner).
```

### Phase 2.2: OCR Implementation and Encrypted Text Extraction

**Objective:** Integrate OCR capabilities into the Document Intelligence Agent to extract text from images and PDFs. The extracted text must be handled securely, encrypted, and stored in a way that allows for future encrypted search.

**Execution Prompt:**

```markdown
**Phase 2.2: OCR Implementation and Encrypted Text Extraction - Execution Prompt**

**Objective:** Integrate OCR to extract text from images/PDFs; ensure extracted text is encrypted and stored securely for future encrypted search.

**Based on:** `digiMe Agentic Architecture Design` (Section 3) and FRD (FR-DM-DP-002, FR-DM-SYS-001, FR-DM-SYS-004).

**Key Tasks:**

1.  **Select and Integrate OCR Engine:**
    *   Research and select a suitable OCR engine. Prioritize engines that can run client-side (e.g., Tesseract.js) or can be securely managed if a server-side component is unavoidable (though client-side is strongly preferred for zero-knowledge).
    *   If server-side OCR is chosen, it *must* operate on encrypted data or within a secure enclave, and the design must be approved by the Privacy Agent for zero-knowledge compliance.
    *   Develop wrappers or modules to integrate the chosen OCR engine into the Document Intelligence Agent's processing pipeline.

2.  **Develop OCR Processing Workflow:**
    *   Design a workflow where, after ingestion (Phase 2.1), image-based documents (JPG, PNG, TIFF) and PDFs are routed to the OCR engine.
    *   Implement pre-processing steps for images if needed to improve OCR accuracy (e.g., deskewing, noise reduction) – these should also ideally run client-side.
    *   Handle multi-page documents effectively.

3.  **Secure Handling of Extracted Text:**
    *   The raw text extracted by OCR is sensitive. It MUST be immediately encrypted client-side using the user's key (via the Privacy Agent's encryption module) before any storage or further server-side processing.
    *   Store the encrypted extracted text alongside the original encrypted document.

4.  **Metadata for Searchability (Encrypted Indexing Preparation):**
    *   While the full text is encrypted, consider if any non-sensitive, derivable metadata from the OCR process (e.g., page count, presence of tables - not the content itself) can be stored to aid high-level filtering. This must be carefully reviewed for privacy implications.
    *   The primary goal is to prepare the encrypted text for future encrypted search capabilities (to be developed in a later phase). This might involve creating an encrypted search index structure.

5.  **Error Handling and Quality Metrics:**
    *   Implement error handling for OCR failures or low-confidence results.
    *   Optionally, implement a mechanism to store OCR confidence scores (if available from the engine) alongside the encrypted text.

6.  **Unit and Integration Tests:**
    *   Test OCR integration with various document types and qualities.
    *   Verify that extracted text is correctly encrypted and stored.
    *   Test error handling for OCR processing.

**Deliverables:**

*   Source code for OCR integration within the Document Intelligence Agent.
*   Workflow for processing and encrypting OCR-extracted text.
*   Updated document representation to include encrypted extracted text.
*   Unit and integration tests for OCR functionality and secure text handling.
*   Documentation on the OCR engine, its integration, and any limitations.

**Handover Summary (for Phase 2.3):**

The Document Intelligence Agent can now perform OCR on image-based documents and PDFs, extract text, and securely encrypt this text using client-side encryption. This lays the groundwork for future encrypted search. The next phase will focus on semantic understanding and relationship mapping of the (encrypted) document content.
```

### Phase 2.3: Semantic Understanding and Encrypted Relationship Mapping

**Objective:** Implement capabilities for the Document Intelligence Agent to perform semantic analysis on the (encrypted) extracted text to identify key concepts, entities, and potential relationships between documents, all while preserving zero-knowledge principles.

**Execution Prompt:**

```markdown

**Objective:** Implement semantic analysis on encrypted text to identify concepts/entities and map relationships, preserving zero-knowledge.

**Based on:** `digiMe Agentic Architecture Design` (Section 3.2) and FRD (FR-DM-DP-004 - related to search indexing, FR-DM-SYS-002).

**Key Tasks:**

1.  **Research Privacy-Preserving NLP Techniques:**
    *   Investigate techniques for performing NLP tasks (like Named Entity Recognition (NER), topic modeling, concept extraction) on encrypted text or in a way that doesn't expose plaintext to a server.
    *   Options might include:
        *   Client-side NLP libraries operating on decrypted text *only in client memory* before re-encrypting results/metadata.
        *   Homomorphic encryption (HE) based NLP (currently research-heavy and potentially slow, but explore feasibility for simple tasks).
        *   Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC) if any server-side collaboration is needed (complex).
        *   Techniques for creating searchable encryption schemes that allow for keyword or concept search on encrypted data.
    *   The primary approach should be client-side processing on temporarily decrypted data.

2.  **Implement Client-Side Semantic Analysis Module:**
    *   Develop a module that, on the client, can temporarily decrypt document text (via Privacy Agent), perform NLP tasks, and then encrypt the derived semantic metadata (e.g., extracted entities, topics, keywords).
    *   Integrate lightweight NLP libraries (e.g., spaCy compiled to WebAssembly, or simpler regex-based entity extractors) for client-side execution.
    *   Focus on extracting key information that can help in organizing and relating documents (e.g., dates, names, organizations, locations, common themes).

3.  **Develop Encrypted Metadata Storage:**
    *   Store the extracted and then re-encrypted semantic metadata (entities, topics, relationships) securely, associated with the document.
    *   This metadata will be crucial for the Organization Agent and for building an encrypted search index.

4.  **Initial Relationship Mapping (Client-Side):**
    *   Based on shared entities or concepts identified client-side, implement a basic mechanism to suggest or identify potential relationships between documents.
    *   For example, if two documents (processed client-side) mention the same unique project ID or person's name, this link can be noted. The link metadata itself must be stored encrypted.

5.  **Update Document Intelligence Agent:**
    *   Integrate this semantic analysis module into the Document Intelligence Agent's processing pipeline. This step runs after OCR and text encryption.
    *   The agent should manage the workflow of decrypting (client-side, temporarily), analyzing, and re-encrypting semantic metadata.

6.  **Unit and Integration Tests:**
    *   Test the client-side NLP module with various text inputs.
    *   Verify that semantic metadata is correctly extracted, encrypted, and stored.
    *   Test the basic relationship identification logic.

3.  **User Confirmation and Learning Mechanism:**
    *   Design a mechanism for the user to confirm, reject, or modify the suggested categories via the frontend (to be developed later, but define the API now).
    *   Implement a learning mechanism where user feedback improves future categorization suggestions. This learning must happen client-side to preserve privacy.

**Key Tasks:**

1.  **Implement Usage Pattern Analysis (Client-Side):**
    *   Develop mechanisms to track (in an encrypted, privacy-preserving manner) how users access and organize their documents.
    *   Track metrics like: frequency of access per category, time spent viewing documents, search patterns, and category changes.
    *   All tracking data must be encrypted and stored locally or in a zero-knowledge manner.

2.  **Develop Organizational Improvement Suggestions:**
    *   Based on usage patterns, implement logic to suggest organizational improvements:
        *   Suggest splitting large categories into subcategories.
        *   Suggest merging rarely-used categories.
        *   Suggest moving frequently accessed documents to more prominent categories.
        *   Suggest creating new categories based on emerging patterns.

        *   File hashes (for exact duplicates).
        *   Semantic similarity (using the encrypted semantic metadata from Phase 2.3).
        *   Filename similarity.
    *   Since content is encrypted, focus on metadata-based approaches and client-side processing for content comparison.
    *   Present duplicate candidates to the user for review and action.

4.  **Automated Maintenance Tasks:**
    *   Implement automated tasks that run periodically:
        *   Clean up empty categories.
        *   Optimize category hierarchies based on usage.
        *   Update document metadata (e.g., last accessed time).
        *   Perform consistency checks on the organization structure.
    *   These tasks should run client-side or in a privacy-preserving manner.
