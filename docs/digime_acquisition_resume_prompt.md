# DigiME AI Agent Resume Prompt - Acquisition-Focused

## Project Overview

DigiME is an AI agent that provides cross-asset pattern recognition and opportunity scoring for digital markets. The project is being developed as an acquisition target, with a focus on technical excellence and compelling demo capabilities rather than user growth or revenue generation.

## Current Project Status

The DigiME agent repository has been initialized with the acquisition-focused documentation structure. The project is ready to begin implementation following the agent-oriented iAI framework, starting with Workstream 1, Phase 1 (Core Agent Architecture).

## Acquisition-Focused Development Approach

As an acquisition target, DigiME development should prioritize:

1. **Technical Excellence**: Focus on the quality and innovation of the pattern recognition and opportunity scoring algorithms
2. **Demo-Readiness**: Create compelling demonstrations that showcase the unique capabilities
3. **Clean Architecture**: Maintain modular, well-documented code that facilitates due diligence
4. **IP Protection**: Carefully document and protect intellectual property to maximize acquisition value

## Key Technical Value Drivers

DigiME's estimated tech-only acquisition value is $20-35M, driven by:
1. **Cross-Asset Pattern Recognition**: Algorithms that identify patterns across different digital asset classes
2. **Opportunity Scoring**: Proprietary scoring system for ranking trading opportunities
3. **Market Correlation Analysis**: Systems for identifying correlations between different digital markets
4. **Predictive Analytics**: Forward-looking analysis based on historical patterns

## Documentation Requirements

When beginning development, ensure all work includes:

1. **Technical Architecture Documentation**:
   - Detailed component diagrams showing modular design
   - Clear documentation of proprietary algorithms
   - API specifications for all integration points

2. **Demo Scenario Documentation**:
   - Specific use cases that showcase unique capabilities
   - Step-by-step demo scripts for different acquirer types
   - Visual assets for compelling demonstrations

3. **Intellectual Property Inventory**:
   - Catalog of proprietary algorithms and approaches
   - Identification of potential patent opportunities
   - Documentation of competitive advantages

4. **Integration Pathway Documentation**:
   - How DigiME could integrate with acquirer systems (market data providers, analytics platforms)
   - Estimated integration timelines and resource requirements
   - Potential synergies with acquirer products

## Next Steps

The immediate next steps for the DigiME agent project are:

1. **Workstream 1, Phase 1 (Core Agent Architecture)**:
   - Design the modular Python-based agent architecture
   - Implement LLM integration for the cognitive core
   - Create the perception-cognition-action loop
   - Develop the working memory system

2. **Acquisition-Readiness Preparation**:
   - Create acquisition-focused documentation templates
   - Develop compelling demo scenarios for potential acquirers
   - Establish intellectual property tracking processes
   - Prepare integration guides for potential acquirer systems

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Code Quality**:
   - Maintain modular architecture with clear separation of components
   - Follow consistent coding standards and practices
   - Ensure comprehensive test coverage
   - Provide thorough inline documentation

2. **Demo Development**:
   - Create a dedicated demo environment
   - Develop realistic data sets for demonstrations
   - Script compelling demonstration scenarios
   - Focus on visually impressive and intuitive interfaces

3. **IP Protection**:
   - Document all innovations and proprietary algorithms
   - Maintain clear ownership of all code
   - Carefully manage open-source dependencies and licenses
   - Regularly assess competitive differentiation

## Beginning Development

When beginning development of the DigiME agent project, please:

1. Review the acquisition-focused documentation
2. Create a project implementation plan following the agent-oriented iAI framework
3. Establish workstreams and phases for structured development
4. Begin with Workstream 1, Phase 1 (Core Agent Architecture)
5. Ensure all development follows the acquisition-focused approach outlined in this document

The agent-oriented iAI framework should guide all development, with a focus on creating a compelling acquisition target through technical excellence and demo-readiness.
