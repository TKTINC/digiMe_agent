# digiMe Execution Prompts & Handover Summaries

## 1. Introduction

This document provides detailed execution prompts and handover summaries for each phase within the modular workstreams designed for the digiMe agentic system. These prompts are intended to guide an AI co-pilot through the implementation of each phase, ensuring consistency and alignment with the overall architecture and functional requirements.

Each prompt includes:
- **Phase Objective**: The primary goal of the phase.
- **Key Deliverables**: Specific outputs expected from the phase.
- **Implementation Steps**: Detailed instructions for the AI co-pilot.
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Conditions for successful phase completion.
- **Handover Summary**: Information to pass to the next phase.

## 2. Workstream: Agent Core

### Phase 1: Agent Framework Setup

**Phase Objective**: Establish the foundational agent architecture, communication system, orchestration layer, and state management.

**Key Deliverables**:
- Core agent framework code structure.
- Initial message-based communication system.
- Basic orchestration layer implementation.
- Agent state management system.

**Implementation Steps (Prompt for AI Co-pilot)**:

```
Implement Phase 1 (Agent Framework Setup) of the Agent Core workstream for digiMe.

Objective: Establish the foundational agent architecture, communication system, orchestration layer, and state management.

Tasks:
1.  Create the base directory structure for the Agent Core module.
2.  Define and implement the base `Agent` class or interface with methods for `initialize`, `process_message`, `get_state`, `set_state`.
3.  Implement a simple message queue (e.g., using an in-memory queue for now, to be replaced later by Kafka/Redis if needed) for inter-agent communication.
4.  Develop a basic `Orchestrator` class responsible for:
    *   Registering/unregistering agents.
    *   Routing messages between agents based on a simple routing table.
5.  Implement an `AgentStateManager` class that allows agents to persist and retrieve their state (e.g., using a simple JSON file per agent for now, to be replaced by a database solution later).
6.  Ensure all components are well-documented with inline comments and basic READMEs.
7.  Write unit tests for the `Agent` base class, `MessageQueue`, `Orchestrator`, and `AgentStateManager`.

Technology Stack: Node.js with TypeScript (unless specified otherwise in architectural documents).

Ensure the design is modular and extensible for future enhancements.
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Core agent framework is implemented and testable.
- Basic message passing between two dummy agents via the orchestrator is functional.
- Agent state can be saved and loaded.
- Unit tests pass with at least 80% coverage for new code.

**Handover Summary to Phase 2 (Agent Communication Protocol)**:
- The foundational Agent Core framework is established, including a basic Orchestrator, Message Queue, and Agent State Manager. The `Agent` base class is defined. The next phase will build upon this by defining formal communication protocols and enhancing the orchestration logic.

---

### Phase 2: Agent Communication Protocol

**Phase Objective**: Implement formal inter-agent messaging protocols, event routing, workflow coordination, and conflict resolution mechanisms.

**Key Deliverables**:
- Defined inter-agent communication protocol (e.g., message schemas, types).
- Enhanced event routing in the Orchestrator.
- Basic workflow coordination system.
- Initial conflict resolution stubs.

**Implementation Steps (Prompt for AI Co-pilot)**:

```
Implement Phase 2 (Agent Communication Protocol) of the Agent Core workstream for digiMe, building upon the Agent Framework from Phase 1.

Objective: Implement formal inter-agent messaging protocols, event routing, workflow coordination, and conflict resolution mechanisms.

Tasks:
1.  Define standardized message schemas (e.g., using JSON Schema or TypeScript interfaces) for inter-agent communication. Include fields like `sender_agent_id`, `recipient_agent_id`, `message_type`, `payload`, `timestamp`, `correlation_id`.
2.  Refactor the `MessageQueue` and `Orchestrator` to use these standardized message schemas.
3.  Enhance the `Orchestrator` to support more sophisticated event routing based on `message_type` and potentially content-based routing rules.
4.  Implement a basic `WorkflowManager` that can define and execute simple, sequential multi-agent workflows (e.g., Agent A sends message, then Agent B processes, then Agent C responds).
5.  Add stubs or basic logic in the `Orchestrator` for conflict resolution (e.g., if multiple agents respond to a broadcast, how to prioritize or merge responses - for now, a simple first-come-first-served or logging mechanism is fine).
6.  Update unit tests to reflect the new message schemas and enhanced Orchestrator/WorkflowManager functionality.

Technology Stack: Node.js with TypeScript.

Ensure the communication protocol is well-documented.
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Standardized message schemas are implemented and used.
- Orchestrator routes messages based on defined protocols.
- Simple multi-agent workflows can be executed.
- Unit tests for new and modified components pass.

**Handover Summary to Phase 3 (Learning & Adaptation Framework)**:
- Formal inter-agent communication protocols and enhanced orchestration are in place. A basic WorkflowManager is functional. The system can now handle structured communication. The next phase will focus on building the framework for agents to learn and adapt.

---

### Phase 3: Learning & Adaptation Framework

**Phase Objective**: Implement feedback collection, preference learning, pattern recognition, and privacy-preserving cross-user learning mechanisms.

**Key Deliverables**:
- Feedback collection module.
- Basic preference learning algorithms.
- Initial pattern recognition system.
- Framework for privacy-preserving cross-user learning (stubs for now).

**Implementation Steps (Prompt for AI Co-pilot)**:

```
Implement Phase 3 (Learning & Adaptation Framework) of the Agent Core workstream for digiMe.

Objective: Implement feedback collection, preference learning, pattern recognition, and privacy-preserving cross-user learning mechanisms.

Tasks:
1.  Design and implement a `FeedbackCollector` module that agents can use to log explicit user feedback (e.g., ratings, corrections) and implicit feedback (e.g., user choices, interaction patterns).
2.  Develop a `PreferenceLearner` module. Initially, this can be a simple system that stores and updates user preferences based on explicit feedback (e.g., user sets a preference for notification frequency).
3.  Create a basic `PatternRecognizer` module. This module could, for example, track the frequency of certain actions or document types and log these patterns. (Advanced pattern recognition will be in specific agent workstreams).
4.  Design the framework for privacy-preserving cross-user learning. Implement stubs for now, outlining how anonymized data could be aggregated and used to improve general agent performance without compromising individual privacy (e.g., using federated learning concepts or differential privacy stubs).
5.  Integrate these modules so that agents can report feedback and access learned preferences/patterns.
6.  Write unit tests for the new modules.

Technology Stack: Node.js with TypeScript.

Focus on creating a flexible framework that can be extended with more sophisticated learning algorithms later.
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Feedback can be collected and stored.
- Basic user preferences can be learned and retrieved.
- Simple patterns can be recognized and logged.
- Framework for advanced learning is in place (stubs).
- Unit tests for new modules pass.

**Handover Summary to Phase 4 (Domain-Specific Language Model Integration)**:
- The Learning & Adaptation Framework is established, allowing agents to collect feedback and learn basic preferences. The next phase will integrate the Domain-Specific Language Model (DsLM) to enhance agent intelligence and natural language capabilities.

---

### Phase 4: Domain-Specific Language Model (DsLM) Integration

**Phase Objective**: Integrate the DsLM, implement natural language understanding, context-aware response generation, and an explanation system.

**Key Deliverables**:
- DsLM integration layer.
- Natural language understanding (NLU) service.
- Context-aware response generation module.
- Explanation generation system.

**Implementation Steps (Prompt for AI Co-pilot)**:

```
Implement Phase 4 (Domain-Specific Language Model Integration) of the Agent Core workstream for digiMe.

Objective: Integrate the DsLM, implement natural language understanding, context-aware response generation, and an explanation system.

Tasks:
1.  Develop an integration layer/client to communicate with the chosen DsLM (e.g., a local LLM instance or an API for a cloud-based LLM, as per architectural decisions). This layer should handle API calls, authentication, and response parsing.
2.  Create an `NLUService` that uses the DsLM to process natural language input from users (e.g., chat messages, voice commands) and extract intent, entities, and sentiment.
3.  Implement a `ResponseGenerator` module that uses the DsLM to generate context-aware natural language responses. This module should consider conversation history and user context.
4.  Develop an `ExplanationGenerator` that leverages the DsLM to provide clear, concise explanations for agent actions or system decisions. This might involve using predefined templates augmented by the DsLM.
5.  Ensure all communication with the DsLM is secure and handles potential errors gracefully.
6.  Write unit tests for the new services and modules, potentially using mock DsLM responses.

Technology Stack: Node.js with TypeScript. Define clear interfaces for DsLM interactions.
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- DsLM is successfully integrated and can be called by other services.
- NLU service can process natural language and extract key information.
- Response generator can create context-aware responses.
- Explanation generator can provide rationales for actions.
- Unit tests pass.

**Handover Summary to Phase 5 (Agent Optimization & Scaling)**:
- The Domain-Specific Language Model is integrated, providing advanced NLU and generation capabilities to the agent ecosystem. The next phase will focus on optimizing agent performance, resource usage, and preparing for scalable deployment.

---

### Phase 5: Agent Optimization & Scaling

**Phase Objective**: Optimize agent performance, implement distributed deployment, develop monitoring/debugging tools, and create versioning/update mechanisms.

**Key Deliverables**:
- Optimized agent performance.
- Distributed agent deployment strategy (e.g., containerization).
- Agent monitoring and debugging tools.
- Agent versioning and update mechanisms.

**Implementation Steps (Prompt for AI Co-pilot)**:

```
Implement Phase 5 (Agent Optimization & Scaling) of the Agent Core workstream for digiMe.

Objective: Optimize agent performance, implement distributed deployment, develop monitoring/debugging tools, and create versioning/update mechanisms.

Tasks:
1.  Profile the performance of existing agent components and identify bottlenecks. Implement optimizations for CPU and memory usage.
2.  Design and implement a strategy for distributed agent deployment. This should include containerizing individual agents or groups of agents (e.g., using Docker).
3.  Develop basic agent monitoring tools. This could include logging key agent metrics (e.g., message processing time, error rates, resource consumption) to a centralized logging system (e.g., ELK stack or CloudWatch stubs).
4.  Implement basic debugging tools, such as enhanced logging capabilities or a simple admin interface to inspect agent states and message queues.
5.  Design and implement a mechanism for agent versioning and updates. This should allow for individual agents to be updated without requiring a full system restart (e.g., by updating container images).
6.  Update deployment scripts and configurations to support the distributed deployment model.
7.  Perform load testing on key agent interactions to ensure scalability.

Technology Stack: Node.js with TypeScript, Docker. Consider tools like Prometheus/Grafana for monitoring stubs.
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Agent performance is measurably improved.
- Agents can be deployed as distributed components (e.g., Docker containers).
- Basic monitoring and debugging tools are functional.
- Agent versioning and update mechanisms are in place.
- System demonstrates improved scalability under load.

**Handover Summary (End of Agent Core Workstream)**:
- The Agent Core workstream is complete. The system now has a robust, scalable, and optimizable agent framework with integrated intelligence capabilities. This core framework will serve as the foundation for all specialized agents in other workstreams.
